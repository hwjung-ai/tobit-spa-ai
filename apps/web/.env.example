# API Base URL Configuration for Client-Side (Browser)
# IMPORTANT: Leave this EMPTY to use Next.js rewrites proxy (RECOMMENDED)
# This makes browser requests go through port 3000, avoiding CORS and network issues
# Only set this if you need direct API access from browser (not recommended for production)
# Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=

# API Base URL Configuration for Server-Side (Next.js SSR/API Routes)
# This is used by Next.js rewrites and SSE proxy to proxy requests to the backend
# Set this in production to point to your API server
# Example: API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Note: This is NOT prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ so it's only available server-side
